# DURU-AI — CC0 BGM (unified)

Background music from the creator's YouTube channels (**DURU-AI**: <https://www.youtube.com/@DURU-AI0503>),
released into the public domain under **CC0 1.0** — free for anything (videos, games, streams,
commercial projects), **no attribution required** (attribution welcome, never obligatory).

This repo unifies the previously separate `duru-cc0-bgm` and `hyak-cc0-bgm` packs into one place.
**MP3 320 kbps** — grab any track from [`mp3/`](mp3/). The Python code that generated the
tracks lives in [`src/`](src/) (see "Source code" below).

**Download options**
- 📦 Everything in one zip: [latest release](https://github.com/uncle-sheepsky/duru-ai-cc0-bgm/releases/latest)

Every track is **composed and produced in code** (Python + NumPy / SciPy). Two groups:

- **[pure]** — 100% synthesized in code, **zero external audio samples**, no VST instruments.
- **[+sfx]** — original music that also layers in **third-party sound effects that are themselves CC0**
  (see "Third-party CC0 audio" below). The whole mix is CC0; these are **not** claimed to be sample-free.

## License — please read

- **All tracks are released under CC0 1.0** (public-domain dedication). Use them for anything —
  no attribution required. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- **Melody**: tracks marked *original* are the creator's own composition. `korobeiniki-*` and
  `hyak-ep2-korobeiniki-tetris` arrange *Korobeiniki* (Коробейники) and `mountainking-*` arranges
  Grieg's *In the Hall of the Mountain King* — both **19th-century, public-domain** melodies anyone
  may freely use. The arrangements & recordings are dedicated to the public domain under CC0.
- **[pure] tracks** are 100% synthesized in code (Python + NumPy / SciPy): no external audio samples,
  no sample libraries, no VST instruments.
- **[+sfx] tracks** are original music with third-party **CC0** sound effects layered in (see below).
  Because every added component is itself CC0, the finished track is CC0 too — but these are, honestly,
  not sample-free.

### Third-party CC0 audio used in the [+sfx] tracks

All of it is public-domain / CC0 and free to redistribute:

- **Sheep "baa" vocalizations** — BigSoundBank (CC0, no attribution).
- **Retro coin / gem one-shots** — *80 CC0 RPG SFX* pack (CC0).
- **Arcade / interface one-shots** (blip, sparkle, coin, boss, laser) — Kenney *Interface Sounds* & *Sci-Fi Sounds* (CC0).
- **Vocal-chop hit** — Freesound (cat-fox_alex, CC0).
- **Glockenspiel / marimba** (ep19) — VSCO 2 Community Edition (CC0) sampled instruments.
- **Faust DSP lead** (ep16 `duru-denparcade`) — a synth instrument *defined in code* (Faust via DawDreamer); output is original synthesis, not a copyrighted VST.

## Source code

[`src/`](src/) contains the Python build scripts that synthesized the **[pure]** hyak tracks and
`duru-ai-ep2-music` — every sound is computed with NumPy/SciPy (shared DSP helpers in
`src/hyak_synth.py`). Run a script next to `hyak_synth.py` and it writes the track as WAV:

```bash
python src/build_track_ep2music_fullver.py
```

The scripts are CC0 like everything else here. Builders for the remaining `duru-*` tracks will be
added progressively.

## Not affiliated with Tetris

*Korobeiniki* is a public-domain folk melody widely recognized from the game *Tetris*. The
`korobeiniki-*` and `hyak-ep2-korobeiniki-tetris` files are independent arrangements of that
public-domain melody and are **not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by Tetris Holding, LLC**.
